## Module-Specific Rules

You will notice that, in this module, the exercises can be solved WITHOUT the standard Containers and WITHOUT the standard Algorithms. However, **using them is precisely the goal of this Module.**

You must use the STL — especially the **Containers** (`vector`/`list`/`map`/and so forth) and the **Algorithms** (defined in header `<algorithm>`) — whenever they are appropriate. Moreover, you should use them as much as you can.

Thus, **do your best to apply them wherever it’s appropriate.** You will get a very bad grade if you don’t, even if your code works as expected. Please don’t be lazy.

You can define your templates in the header files as usual. Or, if you want to, you can write your template declarations in the header files and write their implementations in `.tpp` files. In any case, the header files are mandatory while the `.tpp` files are optional.
